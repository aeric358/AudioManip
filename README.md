All files included are for the waveformfaultoverlay.mlx script to do its calculations properly. 
**At a minimum, bearFreq.m must be in same folder location as harmonicbear.mlx since bearFreq contains the function to be used for the fault harmonic calculations in harmonicbear.mlx**

**MAIN SCRIPTS: testaudiomachine.mlx; fastftaudio.mlx; audiosimilarity.mlx; encplayground.mlx; reconenc.mlx**

**FUNCTION SCRIPTS: generateFFTFeatures.m; generateAudioFeatures.m; extractAndPlayChannel.m; helperPlotMultiChannelAudio.m**

**Step 1: Check/Prepare Audio Files (testaudiomachine.mlx)>[if you want to manually choose features]>(audiosimilarity.mlx)/(fastftaudio.mlx)**

**Step 2a (Unsupervised Learning): (encplayground.mlx)>(reconenc.mlx)**

**Step 2b (Supervised Learning): (audiosimlarity.mlx)**
